## Description
The iOs Developers must take screenshots for 5 different screen resolutions. Recently added one more device - iPad pro. Many developers have so much love to their applications that make them unique screenshots. It is hard work that requires a lot of time. When you update the app - update screenshots is serious problem.

I want to simplify these steps as possible. So I created this Assistant for AppStore. 

Assistant knows how to style your screenshots, automatically keeping style all screenshots. You need to make a real screenshot, think of text - and screenshots for AppStore are ready!

## Installation
You need to use a Sketch for make screenshots. Sketch - a great editor and must be in your list of tools. It's the only thing you need for make screenshots.

## How it use
Select any screenshot from the page "Prepare" and open filling. Click on "Choose Image" and choose your screenshot. Half of the work is done!

Below is a block of text. If you need one language - ignore the second block. Replace the text describing your screenshot, or idea of your application.

Finish! Can watch screenshots on the page "EN Screenshots"

## Features
You can customize your very thinly screenshots. Within the project there are several types of devices, and a huge selection of ready-made beautiful backgrounds. Combining all this you get a unique view of your application in AppStore. 

Also you can add localization in screenshots. See second block with text on page "Prepare"
